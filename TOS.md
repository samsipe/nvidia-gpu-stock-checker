# NVIDIA GPU Stock Checker SMS Notification Service

## Service Description

The NVIDIA RTX Stock Checker is a service that monitors the availability of NVIDIA GPUs. Users can choose to check availability through our website, API, or opt into our optional SMS notification service.

## SMS Notification Terms

If you choose to opt into our optional SMS notification service, you agree to the following terms:

## 1. Consent to Receive Messages

By opting in and providing your mobile phone number, you expressly consent to receive automated SMS notifications from the NVIDIA RTX Stock Checker service regarding GPU availability. This consent is not required to use our stock checking service, which remains available through our website and API regardless of SMS opt-in status.

## 2. Message Frequency

You will only receive messages when there is a change in product availability status (specifically when a product changes from "unavailable" to "available"). We will not send recurring marketing messages. The frequency of messages depends entirely on product availability changes.

## 3. Message and Data Rates

Standard message and data rates may apply. You are responsible for any fees or charges that your wireless carrier may impose for text messaging services.

## 4. Opt-Out Instructions

You may opt out of receiving SMS notifications at any time by:

- Replying to any notification message with "STOP"
- Removing your phone number from the system settings
- Deleting the repository or disabling the GitHub Action
- Contacting the service administrator

## 5. Privacy Policy

Your phone number will only be used for the purpose of sending product availability notifications and will not be shared with third parties except as required to provide the notification service (e.g., Twilio as our SMS provider).

## 6. Support

For customer support or questions about these terms, please submit an issue through the GitHub repository.

## 7. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.

## 8. No Warranty

This service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee the timeliness, accuracy, or reliability of notifications. The service may not capture all instances of product availability.

## 9. Acknowledgment

By opting in and providing your phone number for the SMS notification feature, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these SMS notification terms of service. You understand that opting into SMS notifications is completely optional and not required to use the NVIDIA GPU Stock Checker service.
